Question : Write a Python function that accepts a string and calculates the number of upper case letters and lower case letters.

Sample String : 'Hello Mr. Rogers, how are you this fine Tuesday?'
Expected Output : 
No. of Upper case characters : 4
No. of Lower case Characters : 33


Solution : 
def up_low(s):
    upper = ''
    count = 0
    low = 0
    for char in s:
        if char.isupper() == True:
            count += 1
        elif char.islower() == True :
            low +=1
    print(f'No. of upper case character is {count}')
    # low = len(s)-count
    print(f'No. of lower case character is {low}')


s = 'Hello Mr. Rogers, how are you this fine Tuesday?'
up_low(s)
